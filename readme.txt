TrustBuddy AI: Cybernetic Truth Defense System
Welcome to the GitHub repository for TrustBuddy AI, an innovative AI-powered web application developed for the GenAI Exchange Hackathon (Submission Date: September 21, 2025, 04:20 PM IST). This project aims to combat misinformation and deepfake content in digital media by integrating advanced text analysis, URL credibility scanning, deepfake detection, and user education tools. Designed with a cyberpunk aesthetic, TrustBuddy AI empowers users to verify information in real-time while maintaining privacy through no persistent data storage.
Project Overview

Purpose: A prototype to detect and neutralize misinformation, disinformation, and AI-generated content (deepfakes) using neural networks and image analysis algorithms.
Key Features:

Text Analyzer: Verifies claims (e.g., news articles, social media posts) with trust scores, evidence, and citations from sources like Snopes and WHO.
Deepfake Detector: Analyzes images using color correlation, gradient analysis, and metadata checks to identify AI-generated content.
Truth Academy: Offers interactive simulations to educate users on misinformation detection.
URL Scanner: Assesses domain credibility with risk levels (Trusted, Questionable, High Risk).


Technologies: Python (Streamlit, NumPy, PIL), HTML/CSS (cyberpunk-themed UI with Orbitron/Roboto Mono fonts), TikZ (diagrams), and integrations with external fact-checking APIs.
AI Integration: Leverages custom AI algorithms for text and image processing; optional Google Cloud AI compatibility for scalable deployment (pending hackathon requirements).
